With competitive gaming on the rise, games are much more team-based now where social interaction and chemistry is crucial to any successful team. However, this can be difficult to achieve when each game is played with strangers. Due to the nature of gaming it can be difficult to meet and interact with other gamers and build a team of genuinely compatible friends.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"px-4 text-justify\">\r\n              SynerG provides a platform for gamers who share a passion for a game to find and socialise with each other and form a team with strong bonds and chemistry.
