However, this can be difficult to achieve when each game is played with strangers. Due to the nature of gaming it can be difficult to meet and interact with other gamers and build a team of genuinely compatible friends.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"px-4 text-justify\">\r\n              SynerG provides a platform for gamers who share a passion for a game to find and socialise with each other and form a team with strong bonds and chemistry. Grow as a team and enjoy the game with your friends and escape from the toxicity that can often be the result of matchmaking with strangers.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"px-4 text-justify\">\r\n              We hope we can help you become the next world-renowned competitive team!\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </section>\r\n\r\n  <!-- Footer -->\r\n  <footer class=\"footer\">\r\n    <div class=\"container\">\r\n      <div class=\"row\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-6 h-100 text-center text-lg-left my-auto\">\r\n          <ul class=\"list-inline mb-2\">\r\n            <li class=\"list-inline-item\">\r\n              <a href=\"#\">About</a>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li class=\"list-inline-item\">&sdot;</li>\r\n            <li class=\"list-inline-item\">\r\n              <a href=\"#\">Contact</a>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li class=\"list-inline-item\">&sdot;</li>\r\n            <li class=\"list-inline-item\">\r\n              <a href=\"#\">Terms of Use</a>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li class=\"list-inline-item\">&sdot;</li>\r\n            <li class=\"list-inline-item\">\r\n              <a href=\"#\">Privacy Policy</a>\r\n            </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <p class=\"text-muted small mb-4 mb-lg-0\">&copy; SynerG 2018.
